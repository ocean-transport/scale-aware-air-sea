# scale-aware-air-sea
Repo for collaborative project on scale-aware air-sea fluxes in global climate models

### Project goal
To cleanly separate small-scale contributions of different scales to the total air-sea flux of heat, freshwater, etc.

### Project steps
- apply spatial filters to air-sea fluxes (use [gcmfilters](https://gcm-filters.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) to remove small-scales 
- compare air-sea fluxes of full and filtered fields

### Theory and Method
See [this Overleaf document](https://www.overleaf.com/project/612d80264096d8572283672f)
