# scale-aware-air-sea
This repository is both an installable package, and a collection of issues/notebooks that document the work done in the ocean-transport group and beyond.
The goal of this project is to quantify the rectified effect of small scale heterogeneity in the atmophere and ocean on the air-sea fluxes computed via bulk formulae.
